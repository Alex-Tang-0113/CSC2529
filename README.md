# CSC2529
This is the source code of assignments and the final project for the course Computational imaging [CSC2529](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~lindell/teaching/2529/) at the University of Toronto.

## Course Description
Computational imaging systems have a wide range of applications in consumer electronics, scientific imaging, HCI, medical imaging, microscopy, and remote sensing. We discuss digital photography and basic image processing, convolutional neural networks for image processing, denoising, deconvolution, single pixel imaging, inverse problems in imaging, proximal gradient methods, introduction to wave optics, time-of-flight imaging, end-to-end optimization of optics and imaging processing. Emphasis is on applied image processing and solving inverse problems using classic algorithms, formal optimization, and modern artificial intelligence techniques. Students learn to apply material by implementing and investigating image processing algorithms in Python and completing a term project.

Topics include:

- Human visual perception
Digital cameras and ISPs
Denoising, deconvolution, and other inverse problems in imaging
Convolutional neural networks for solving inverse problems
Proximal gradient methods / formal optimization for solving inverse problems
High dynamic range imaging
Light field imaging
Time-of-flight imaging, non-line-of-sight imaging
End-to-end optimization of optics and image processing
... other interesting topics.
